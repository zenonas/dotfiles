A collection of my dotfiles

Installation
=============

To install just clone the repository anywhere on your system and run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenonas/dotfiles.git
make install or ./install.sh if make is unavailable
```

Any old dot files that get replaced will be moved to ~/.dotfiles_backup
